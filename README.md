=======================


Data Structures and Algorithms project.


It is a C++ project which is written in 2011 by Anil Kayan and Onur Ozuduru for Data Structures and Algorithms class. 
This is our first project at university, I remember that how we'd searched and compared some sorting algorithms before we wrote the code :') OK, after the emotional sentences, 
let me give some information about the code :)
It is a simple console application. It takes a text file and counts the words in that file. 
There are more information on _ProjectDescription.pdf_ file. 


Also you can see explanation of the code on _ProjectReport.pdf_ 


It is tested with the files which are under the _example-txt-files_ directory. 


Example usage: ./wordcounter marktwain-huckfin.txt


We hope that it is helpful, please put a link to our github pages on your work if you use that code with no changes (directly copied).
